# Contributing

Thanks for checking out EvacSim! Please familiarize yourself with our [code of conduct](CONDUCT.md) before you begin contributing to the project.

You can look through the [open issues](https://github.com/MattCzyr/EvacSim/issues) to get an idea of what you can work on. We recommend beginning with issues with the [good first issue](https://github.com/MattCzyr/EvacSim/labels/good%20first%20issue) label, but feel free to choose anything that interests you. After that, fork the project and get started.

Once you're done, run the test suite with `python -m unittest discover -s test/` to ensure all tests still pass. We also recommend adding unit tests for any new functionality you've added. Once you're done, you can open a pull request to get your work on your fork merged into the base repository.

If you have any questions about contributing, please open a discussion on the [discussions page](https://github.com/MattCzyr/EvacSim/discussions) and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
